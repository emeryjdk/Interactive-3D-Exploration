    "##  Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to formulate interactive 3D representations of difficult-to-visualize materials science objects such as crystals, polymers dislocations, and ternary phase diagrams. We intend for these models to access but rich in instructional efficacy, providing students with interactive views that can assist with 3D visualization and higher-order spatial reasoning. With the perspective of the user, we want a very limited set of controls to avoid confusing nascent materials scientists and engineers and to improve accessibility for the busy student.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  In the first phase, we will target simple crystal structures discussed in MAT\\_SCI 201 and 301, and provide rotatable structures with various views (hard-sphere packing, sparse views, cut-widget-controlled transparency and atomic size). We will use previously constructed Asymptote\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  In the second phase we want to expand these models to more complex shapes (e.g, beyond primitives) and enable slicing/cutting of volumes. Also allow for data import and presentation of complex 3D datasets (e.g., tessellated surfaces to render ternary phase diagrams).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  In the third phase, we want to make this accessible to others. This includes good documentation during the project, but also keeping in  mind the ultimate intent of the this project --- to have other instructors use this software (with minimal assistance) to teach in  their own classes. This means the creation of Jupyter templates for (as-)easy(-as-possible) use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  In phase four: can we acquire data? How do I know how long, and in what manner, students are interacting with these objects?\n",

    "## `ipyvolume` install via `Jupyter`/`Conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize Jupyter to create sharable notebooks with ipyvolume libraries installed and Jupyter extensions activated. We will host files on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Anaconda download (bundles Jupyter and most relavent libraries:)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll install full Anaconda distribution for the local user. This requires about 3 GB of disk space. Miniconda should work --- I haven't tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Follow the directions [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/windows.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Open the Anaconda Prompt and type `conda list` to get a list of installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  To access to bundled Jupyter notebook, you can either use the Anaconda Prompt, or add Python and Conda to your path. [This link](https://youtu.be/dgjEUcccRwM) shows us how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Type `jupyter notebook` into the prompt. Jupyter should start up in  your preferred browser and access your C:\\\n",

    "2.  `$ conda install -c conda-forge ipyvolume`\n",

    "4.  `$ jupyter nbextension enable –py –user widgetsnbextension` (I think this is necessary with Conda install)\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be a number of issues with this install --- I had to update a number of different libraries to get this to work. To check, you can open a Jupyter Notebook and attempt an example from [IPyvolume](http://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We won't know this until we get going, but is [`ipyvolume`](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume) the correct choice? It's still pre-release and is probably limited (v0.4.0). It does seem active (discussion as of 2018-07-10), butd evelopment on the main branch on GitHub seems slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We must ensure embed-ability in HTML on *Canvas*. We should check HTML outputs early to make sure they can be ported.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "re we using the right thing? Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-g3E3aAgEo) to get the state-of-the-art. Maybe contact these folks? They are at www.opendreamkit.org, contact Vidar Tonaas Fauske (vidar\\@simula.no). Seems they've removed a lot of the head-ache inducing stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "I went with IPyvolume because it is volumetric rendering based on grids and has widgets enabled for control. Non-gridded representations may be a challenge\\...\n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't explored these:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `yt`: which looks more developed and cleaner. Nice visualization and LaTeX annotation. Mostly astrophysics examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `VTK`: historied, interactive with Paraview, lots of good, simple examples for primitives. High-level language? They are seemingly developing a lot of their own stuff\\...\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Myavi`: Beautiful, but generates static HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `pythreejs`: Most fundamental package? Generic, and uses already-existing 3D libraries. Has some more custom interactivity. Good for investigating data --- save out states.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `CrystalWalk`: Limited only to crystals.\n",
    "\n",
